Most sensors of the 21st century use either the Charged Coupled Device (CCD) or the Complementary Metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology due to the vivacity and color clarity offered. There are several monocular and binocular hues for depth sensory along with infrared technologies in common practice, yet there currently stands no universally precise method for depth interpretation visually for machine vision/learning.  The Kinect, with its infrared sensor, delivers a 640*480 depth-map static image via live feed that produces not only a relatively accurate depth sensor, but also background detection and extraction, and even blob detection for moving aspects, more specifically the user.
